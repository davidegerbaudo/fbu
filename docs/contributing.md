How to contribute:
- our git workflow

    git status (master, clean, up to date with origin)
    git checkout -b some-project
    git add some.txt
    git add file.txt
    git commit -m "some file, etc"
    git push origin some-project

- recommendations about commit messages
Follow Linus' guidelines: one short descriptive line, followed by a
longer description of the motivation and implementation, if
necessary. Limit line length (with emacs M-q or M-x fill-paragraph)

- report issues and bugs
Use the github tool.
